.Sh NAME
.Nm mkd-extensions
.Nd Extensions to the Markdown text formatting syntax
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This version of markdown has been extended in a few ways by
extending existing markup, creating new markup from scratch,
and borrowing markup from other markup languages.
.Ss Image dimensions
Markdown embedded images have been extended to allow specifying
the dimensions of the image by adding a new argument
.Em =/height/x/width/
to the link description.
.Pp
The new image syntax is
.nf
	![alt text](image =/height/x/width/ "title")
.fi
.Ss pseudo-protocols
Three pseudo-protocols have been added to links
.Bl -tag -width XXXXX
.It Ar id:
The 
.Ar "alt text"
is marked up and written to the output, wrapped with
.Em "<a id=id>"
and
.Em "</a>" .
.It Ar class:
The
.Ar "alt text"
is marked up and written to the output, wrapped with
.Em "<span class=class>"
and
.Em "</span>" .
.It Ar raw:
The
.Ar title
is written
.Em -- with no further processing --
to the output.  The 
.Ar "alt text"
is discarded.
.It Ar abbr:
The
.Ar "alt text"
is marked up and written to the output, wrapped with
.Em "<abbr title="abbr">
and
.Em "</abbr>" .
.El
.Ss Pandoc headers
If markdown was configured with
.Ar --enable-pandoc-header ,
the markdown source document can have a 3-line 
.Xr Pandoc
header in the format of
.nf
    % title
    % author(s)
    % date
.fi
which will be made available to the
.Fn mkd_doc_title ,
.Fn mkd_doc_author ,
and
.Fn mkd_doc_date
functions.
.Ss Definition lists
If markdown was configured with
.Ar --enable-dl-tag ,
markup for definition lists is enabled.  A definition list item
is defined as
.nf
=tag=
    description
.fi
(that is a
.Ar = ,
followed by text, another
.Ar = ,
a newline, 4 spaces of intent, and then more text.)
.Pp
.Ss embedded stylesheets
Stylesheets may be defined and modified in a
.Em <style>
block.   A style block is parsed like any other
block level html;  
.Em <style>
starting on column 1, raw html (or, in this case, css) following
it, and either ending with a 
.Em </style>
at the end of the line or a
.Em </style>
at the beginning of a subsequent line.
.Pp
Be warned that style blocks work like footnote links -- no matter
where you define them they are valid for the entire document.
.Ss relaxed emphasis
If markdown was configured with
.Ar --relaxed-emphasis ,
the rules for emphasis are changed so that a single
.Ar _
will
.Em not
count as a emphasis character if it's in the middle of a word.
This is primarily for documenting code, if you don't wish to
have to backquote all code references.
.Ss alpha lists
If markdown was configured with
.Ar --enable-alpha-list ,
alphabetic lists (like regular numeric lists, but with alphabetic
items) are supported.    So:
.nf
    a. this
    b. is
    c. an alphabetic
    d. list
.fi
will produce:
.nf
    <ol type=a>
    <li>this</li>
    <li>is</li>
    <li>an alphabetic</li>
    <li>list</li>
    </ol>
.fi
.Ss tables
.Ar PHP Markdown Extra -style
tables are supported;  input of the form
.nf
    header|header
    ------|------
     text | text
.fi
will produce:
.nf
    <table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
    <th>header</th>
    <th>header</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td>text</td>
    <td>text</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
.fi
The dashed line can also contain
.Em :
characters for formatting;  if a 
.Em :
is at the start of a column, it tells
.Nm discount
to align the cell contents to the left;  if it's at the end, it
aligns right, and if there's one at the start and at the
end, it centers.
